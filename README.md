Use gbc_load_and_estimate to predict the crystal structure of High-entropy alloys.

Enter an alloy in this format: AlCo3.5CrCu0.5FeNi

The program will guess the crystal structure at an accuracy of roughly 75%.

The folders contain the training processes for each of the four models tested.
The gradientboostingclassifier had the best model accuracy.
